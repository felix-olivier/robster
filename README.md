# Custom Hitster
With [this 
notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UEM7Gr1b$) 
you can generate your own 
version of Hitster based on a Spotify 
playlist. 
Follow these steps to create a double sided 
printable PDF with custom Hitster cards:

- Step 1: Create a playlist on Spotify.
- Step 2: Export information about the playlist 
as a CSV file using 
[Exportify](https://exportify.net/).
- Step 3: Run the cell below by clicking on the 
triangle button on the left. You will be asked 
to upload the CSV file as downloaded from 
Exportify.
- Step 4: Download the resulting 
_custom_hitster.pdf_ file from the folder icon 
on the left.


Notes:
- A playlist with variation in 
release years will  make the game more 
interesting.
- The resulting PDF is in A4 format.
- The QR codes that are generated are links to 
Spotify tracks, so using the Hitster app to 
scan the QR codes will not work. Instead, use 
an app that plays songs on Spotify by scanning 
a QR code (to be released).
